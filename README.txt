This is a pretty basic platformer with random level generation. The speed increases slowly the further and further the player gets.

Current score and high score is recorded. Can increase score through regular running or picking up coins (bronze, silver, gold). Can further increase score by picking up certain powerups that multiply the score

Spikes are randomly placed for more danger to the player. Can deactivate spikes for a short period of time with one of the powerups
